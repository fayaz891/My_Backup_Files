goto the https://fonts.google.com </br>
you found large numbers of fonts . click on +(add) buton ,you will found a link , copy that link and paste in head tag anywhere and then make a css in style tag and you have a font-family from where you copied a link and that font-family paste in a css tag .
2 font-family is sufficint for each websit,other wise it will make load on server which will take too much time and reduce speed of browser.
